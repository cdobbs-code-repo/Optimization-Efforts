The Kelly Criterion is an interesting optimization of the size of one's bet that came from Information Theory. I believe Claude Shannon actually used the Kelly Criterion to make money in Vegas with a colleague. 

This criterion can be applied to many probabilistic situations, but without concrete numbers, the applicability is questionable. In other words, if you know the expected risk (e.g. 50%), the expected payoff, and the amount of money available to you, then - if you are certain you have "side information" that gives a certain level of adjusted risk (+5% for instance) - you can calculate the exact amount of money to risk in order to gain the maximum expected returns with repeated gameplay. Without "side information" or concrete values regarding risk and return, the Kelly Criterion is arguably less useful.

Lastly, this program does not endorse gambling, but moneyline betting was the easiest implementation I could think of at the time.
