This code is designed to solve all currents and voltages for any given fault on a generic two source system.

Surprisingly, we can always form a linear set of equations and solve by obtaining reduced row echelon form. This is a surprise because when a path to ground has near infinite resistance, we can still use the equation to solve the system.
